# Hammurabi

## Project Overview

Hammurabi is a Rust CLI daemon that monitors one or more GitHub repositories' issue boards and orchestrates an AI agent to automate the issue lifecycle (spec drafting → approval → implementation) with mandatory human approval at every step. The default agent is the Claude CLI; `agent_kind = "acp-claude" | "acp-gemini" | "acp-codex"` opts a repo or individual task into an Agent Client Protocol subprocess instead.

In addition to GitHub label polling, Hammurabi can accept ideas from chat intake sources — today Discord, designed so additional platforms slot in behind the same `DiscordClient` / `Publisher` shape. A Discord-originated intake creates a thread, drafts the spec interactively, and opens a GitHub issue on `/confirm`; the existing implementation/review/PR pipeline then runs unchanged.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build --release    # Always use release builds
cargo test               # Run all unit + integration tests
```

## Architecture

- **Pure state machine** (`src/state_machine.rs`) -- all transitions are `(State, Event) -> Vec<SideEffect>` with no I/O
- **Trait-based abstractions** -- `GitHubClient`, `DiscordClient`, `AiAgent`, `WorktreeManager`, `Publisher` traits enable mock-based testing
- **Multi-repo + multi-intake support** -- `Config` holds `Vec<RepoConfig>` (GitHub label polling) plus `Vec<SourceEntry>` (chat intakes like Discord); canonical issue identity is `(source, repo, external_id)` where `external_id` is the GitHub issue number or Discord thread snowflake
- **Database** (`src/db.rs`) -- SQLite with WAL mode, wrapped in `Mutex` for thread safety; `UNIQUE(source, repo, external_id)` scopes rows across sources
- **Publisher** (`src/publisher.rs`) -- source-agnostic progress abstraction. `GithubPublisher` posts issue comments; `DiscordPublisher` posts thread messages; `MultiplexPublisher` fans out. `TransitionContext::publisher_for(issue)` picks the right one at the call site
- **Transitions** (`src/transitions/`) -- one module per active state, each performing the actual work; `spec_drafting` branches on `issue.source`
- **Poller** (`src/poller.rs`) -- main daemon loop that iterates over all configured repos each cycle; `discord_intake_once` handles new @mentions for a configured Discord channel

## Key Conventions

- All external dependencies are behind traits (GitHub, Discord, AI, git worktrees, Publisher)
- Test with mocks in `#[cfg(test)] mod mock` blocks within each module
- State machine tests must be exhaustive -- one test per valid transition
- Integration tests live in `tests/` and use `#[path = ...]` to import modules
- `rusqlite` is used (not sqlx) per design spec -- synchronous access wrapped in `Mutex`
- Agents live behind `AgentKind` + `AgentRegistry` — add a new kind by extending `src/agents/mod.rs::AgentKind`, registering it in `poller::build_agent_registry`, and (for ACP) supplying an `AcpAgentDef` default in `src/agents/acp.rs`
- Intake sources live behind `DiscordClient` (and peer traits for future platforms) — a Discord-sourced row has `source=Discord`, `external_id=<thread_id>`, and `github_issue_number=0` until `/confirm` opens the GitHub issue
- Secrets in config (`bot_token`, etc.) expand via `${VAR}` from the environment and use a manual `Debug` impl so they never leak into logs

## Discord intake status

The Discord runtime ships behind the `discord` Cargo feature:

```bash
cargo build --release --features discord
cargo run  --release --features discord watch
```

Default builds (no feature) still compile and run; `[[sources]]` entries
log a warning and are skipped. With the feature on, `SerenityDiscordClient`
talks to the Discord REST API for fetch / post / edit / start-thread, and
`run_daemon`:

1. Connects via `GET /users/@me` to resolve the bot's own id.
2. Seeds a per-channel cursor from the most recent message so a cold
   start doesn't re-play history.
3. After each repo's `poll_cycle`, calls `discord_intake_once` for every
   Discord source targeting that repo, advancing the cursor.

Phase 4's `tests/integration_discord_lifecycle.rs` continues to exercise
the entire lifecycle under mocks (feature-independent). The Gateway
WebSocket path (real-time UX instead of tick-based polling) is a future
upgrade behind the same trait — add `client`/`gateway` to serenity's
features, spawn an `EventHandler` task in `run_daemon`, and bridge
events into the existing handlers.
